# pyHP

This is an extension for pyRevit. pyRevit (with lowercase *py*) is a Rapid Application Prototyping (RAD) environment for Autodesk RevitÂ®.

Besides the many useful tools that come with 'vanilla' pyRevit, the platform that pyRevit provides is invaluable for rapid Revit API tools prototyping and makes deployment a breeze. 

pyHP is a collection of tools created by [Archilizer](https://www.archilizer.com/) for [Hutchinson & Partners](https://hutchinsonandpartners.com/).
